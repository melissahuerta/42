         <!--
        When a click occurs on the balloon, its size will grow by 10px while keeping its round shape.
        With each click its color will go in that order from red to green, then blue and back to red again.
        Usually, this type of balloon is rather resistant but if its size becomes greater than 420px 
        it will explode and return to its original size.
        
        Small additional detail, when the mouse is in the balloon and leaves it,
        the size of the balloon shrinks by 5px (the size of the balloon cannot go lower than 200px)
        and its color changes in the reverse order than mentioned earlier.
