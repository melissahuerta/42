    For this exercise, we will create a basic calculator. To start, your HTML file will have a basic structure similar to the one seen in the introduction video. No library allowed. The design doesn’t matter as long as the exercise is still doable.
First, let’s model our calculator. It will be composed as follows:
• A text input field that represents the left member of our calculation.
• A select field that will contain a list of the following operators as options:(’+’,
’-’, ’*’, ’/’, ’%’).
• A text input field that represents the right member of our calculation. • A submit input of value ’Try me!’.
When we click on the button ’Try me!’, the calculation is executed and the result appears in an alert message. The result also needs to be displayed on the console of your browzer (log).
Both inputs fields can only contain positive integer values(>= 0) for the calculation to be executed. Otherwise display an alert message must appear with the following message ’Error :(’.

Division and modulo by zero display an alert message with the following message: "It’s over 9000!". The result also needs to be displayed on the console of your browzer (log)
Every 30 seconds, an alert pop-up windows will appear saying ’Please, use me...’.
