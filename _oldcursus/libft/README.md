# 42-libft

> Our first own library, yay!

The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that we’ll be allowed to use in all the other (future) projects.

## Learning ~ 🤓
By recreating many functions from the C library, I learned about:

- Allocating and freing memory, Stack and heap memory.
- Working with pointer to functions
- Linked lists

## Solving ~ 🧐
In the pdf instructions you'll find some distribution of the functions requested, but it doesn't mean they are sorted by difficulty, I'll recommend to start with the easiest ones as `putchar`, `strlen` cause some other functions depend on those.

I built some tests that you can find on the "main" directory inside this project.

Personally I had issues understanding `strlcat` and its behaviour, here is an useful [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33154740/strlcat-is-dst-always-nul-terminated-what-are-size-and-the-returned-value)

## Grade ~ 👩🏽‍💻
